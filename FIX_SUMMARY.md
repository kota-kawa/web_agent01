## Yahoo Homepage Navigation Bug Fix - Summary

### Problem Solved ✅
Fixed the bug where tasks would unexpectedly return to Yahoo's top page during execution, interrupting ongoing tasks.

### Root Cause 🔍
The issue was in the browser recreation mechanism:
- Every 50 actions, the browser was recreated for stability
- During recreation, the current page URL was lost
- Tasks would lose their context and potentially navigate back to Yahoo

### Solution Implemented 🛠️

#### 1. URL Preservation During Browser Recreation
```python
# BEFORE: Browser recreation lost current URL
async def _recreate_browser():
    # Close browser, lose context
    await _init_browser()  # Empty page

# AFTER: URL is preserved and restored
async def _recreate_browser():
    # Save current URL before closing
    current_url = None
    if PAGE and current_url != DEFAULT_URL and not current_url.startswith("about:"):
        current_url = await PAGE.url()
    
    # Recreate browser
    await _init_browser()
    
    # Navigate back to preserved URL
    if current_url:
        await PAGE.goto(current_url)
```

#### 2. Optimized Health Checks
```python
# BEFORE: Always initialize browser
@app.get("/source")
def source():
    _run(_init_browser())  # Always runs
    return Response(_run(_safe_get_page_content()))

# AFTER: Only initialize if needed
@app.get("/source")  
def source():
    if not PAGE or not _run(_check_browser_health()):
        _run(_init_browser())  # Only if unhealthy
    return Response(_run(_safe_get_page_content()))
```

### Test Results 🧪
- ✅ 6/6 URL preservation logic tests passed
- ✅ Yahoo homepage correctly excluded from preservation
- ✅ External task URLs properly preserved
- ✅ Health check optimization working
- ✅ All validation tests passed

### Impact 🎯
1. **Task Continuity**: No more interruptions returning to Yahoo homepage
2. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary browser initializations 
3. **Stability**: Maintained periodic refresh for browser health
4. **Compatibility**: First startup still goes to Yahoo as expected

The fix ensures tasks can run for extended periods without losing their context while maintaining system stability.
