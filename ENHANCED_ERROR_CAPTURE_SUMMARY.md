# Enhanced Playwright Error Capture Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses the requirement to ensure that all Playwright errors, including minor ones, are properly captured and included in both the JSON "warning" field and prompt.py's error_line for better LLM understanding.

## Problem Statement (Japanese)
> きちんと、LLMにエラーや不具合の内容を理解させるために、jsonの"warning"とprompt.pyのerror_lineにplaywrightのエラーをきちんと入れられるようにしてほしい。些細なエラーでも入れてほしい。

**Translation**: "To properly make the LLM understand the content of errors and defects, I want Playwright errors to be properly included in the JSON 'warning' and prompt.py's error_line. I want even minor errors to be included."

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Error Capture in `agent/browser/vnc.py`

**Key Improvements:**
- **Comprehensive Playwright Error Detection**: Added pattern detection for common Playwright error indicators in response data
- **Enhanced HTTP Error Details**: Capture response body content from failed HTTP requests for detailed error context
- **Improved Connection Error Classification**: Categorize different types of connection failures (DNS, timeout, refused, etc.)
- **Stack Trace Analysis**: Capture and analyze stack traces for unexpected errors
- **Minor Error Capture**: Detect and include informational messages that might be relevant for debugging

**New Error Patterns Detected:**
- Element state issues (not visible, detached, not clickable)
- Selector resolution problems
- Execution context errors
- Page/browser lifecycle issues
- Console errors and warnings
- Network and connection details

### 2. Improved Error Processing in `agent/controller/prompt.py`

**Key Improvements:**
- **Expanded Keyword Detection**: Added comprehensive list of Playwright-specific error terms
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Added specific Playwright error patterns beyond simple keywords
- **Recent Warnings Integration**: Include warnings from recent conversation history in error context
- **Enhanced Context Capture**: Increased context lines (15 vs 10) and improved contextual information inclusion
- **Fixed Template Issues**: Resolved malformed system prompt template causing display issues

**New Error Keywords Added:**
- Playwright-specific: `locator`, `selector`, `detached`, `intercepted`, `page closed`, `context closed`
- Action-specific: `click`, `type`, `hover`, `scroll`, `screenshot`, `evaluate`
- State-specific: `not clickable`, `not hoverable`, `outside viewport`, `disabled`, `readonly`
- Network-specific: `connection`, `http`, `request`, `response`, `dns`, `refused`

### 3. Enhanced Async Executor Error Handling

**Key Improvements:**
- **Comprehensive Exception Capture**: Include error type and detailed error information
- **Stack Trace Analysis**: Analyze stack traces for Playwright-related errors
- **Multiple Warning Support**: Generate multiple warnings from different error aspects

### 4. Testing and Validation

**Created Comprehensive Tests:**
- `test_enhanced_error_capture.py`: New comprehensive test suite
- Validates JSON warning enhancements
- Tests error_line processing improvements
- Verifies network error classification
- Confirms recent warnings integration

**All Original Tests Pass:**
- `test_integration_warning_flow.py`: Original test suite continues to pass
- Backwards compatibility maintained
- No regression in existing functionality

## Benefits for LLM Understanding

### Before vs After Comparison

**Before:**
- Limited error keywords captured
- Basic connection error messages
- No integration of recent warnings
- Minimal Playwright-specific error context

**After:**
- Comprehensive Playwright error pattern detection
- Detailed network error classification with specific causes
- Integration of recent warnings from conversation history
- Minor error capture including informational messages
- Enhanced context with stack traces and execution details

### Example Error Capture

**Previous Implementation:**
```json
{
  "warnings": ["ERROR:auto:Connection error"]
}
```

**Enhanced Implementation:**
```json
{
  "warnings": [
    "ERROR:auto:Connection refused - Automation server not accepting connections: Connection refused",
    "INFO:playwright:execution_info=Element state: detached, selector: button#submit, timeout: 30000ms",
    "ERROR:playwright:console_errors=[\"TypeError: Cannot read property 'click' of null\"]",
    "RECENT:ERROR:auto:Element not clickable - covered by overlay"
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`agent/browser/vnc.py`**: Enhanced error capture in `execute_dsl` function
2. **`agent/controller/prompt.py`**: Improved error_line processing and recent warnings integration
3. **`agent/controller/async_executor.py`**: Enhanced exception handling in async execution
4. **`test_enhanced_error_capture.py`**: New comprehensive test suite (created)
5. **`demo_enhanced_error_improvements.py`**: Demonstration script (created)

## Usage Impact

### For Developers
- More detailed error information for debugging
- Better error classification and categorization
- Comprehensive error context from multiple sources

### For LLM
- Enhanced understanding of automation failures
- Better context for error recovery decisions
- Comprehensive information about minor issues that affect automation
- Historical context from recent warnings

## Validation

✅ **All original tests pass** - No regression in existing functionality  
✅ **New comprehensive tests pass** - Enhanced functionality validated  
✅ **Error capture works for both JSON warnings and prompt error_line**  
✅ **Minor errors are now captured and included**  
✅ **Recent warnings are integrated from conversation history**  
✅ **Network errors are properly classified and detailed**

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the requirement to ensure comprehensive Playwright error capture, including minor errors, in both JSON warnings and prompt error_line. The LLM now receives significantly more detailed and actionable error information, enabling better understanding and recovery from automation issues.
