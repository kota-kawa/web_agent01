# Polling Improvements for Execution Status Errors

## Problem Statement

The system was experiencing frequent "⚠️ 実行状態の確認に失敗しました" (Execution status check failed) errors during async browser operations. These errors were alarming to users and often occurred even when the underlying operations were successful.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues identified were:

1. **Fragile Polling Mechanism**: The status polling was too aggressive and failed easily on temporary network issues
2. **Poor Error Recovery**: Limited fallback strategies when status checks failed
3. **Alarming Error Messages**: Generic failure messages that didn't provide useful context
4. **Network Sensitivity**: System was overly sensitive to temporary connection issues

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Polling Mechanism (`browser_executor.js`)

**Before:**
- Fixed 500ms intervals
- 45 max attempts (22.5s timeout)
- 5 consecutive error tolerance
- Simple timeout handling

**After:**
- Adaptive intervals: 300ms to 3s with exponential backoff
- 60 max attempts (90s timeout)
- 3 consecutive error tolerance for faster fallback
- Progressive timeout per request (3s to 8s)
- Better error categorization (client vs server vs network)

```javascript
// Example of new adaptive polling
const baseInterval = Math.min(initialInterval + (attempt * 50), 2000);
const errorMultiplier = consecutiveErrors > 0 ? Math.min(2 ** consecutiveErrors, 4) : 1;
const interval = Math.min(baseInterval * errorMultiplier, 3000);
```

### 2. Graceful Fallback System

**New Function: `attemptGracefulFallback()`**

When polling fails, the system now:

1. **Attempts Page State Recovery**: Tries to get current HTML via `/vnc-source`
2. **Checks Server Health**: Validates both main server and automation server
3. **Provides Context**: Returns detailed information about what succeeded/failed
4. **Categorizes Failures**: Distinguishes between different failure types

```javascript
// Multiple recovery strategies
let fallbackHtml = await fetch("/vnc-source", {
  signal: controller.signal,
  headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache' }
});

let serverHealthy = await checkServerHealth();
let automationHealthy = await checkAutomationServerHealth();
```

### 3. Improved Error Messages

**Before:**
- "⚠️ 実行状態の確認に失敗しました" (alarming, generic)

**After:**
- "✅ ブラウザ操作が完了しました（フォールバック経由）" (completion via fallback)
- "⚠️ 状態確認にエラーがありましたが、ページ状態を取得できました" (partial success)
- "💡 操作は完了している可能性があります。必要に応じてページを手動で確認してください。" (helpful guidance)

### 4. Enhanced Health Checks

**Server-side (`web/app.py`):**
- Extended health endpoint with VNC server status
- Component-wise health reporting
- Task metrics and load indicators
- Graceful degradation (206 status for partial functionality)

```python
health_status = {
    "status": "healthy" if vnc_healthy else "degraded",
    "components": {
        "async_executor": "available",
        "vnc_server": "healthy" if vnc_healthy else "unhealthy",
    },
    "metrics": {
        "total_tasks": total_tasks,
        "active_tasks": len(active_tasks),
        "load_indicator": load_indicator
    }
}
```

**Client-side:**
- Retry logic for health checks (2 attempts)
- Progressive timeouts (3s, 4s, 5s)
- Dual health check strategy (main + automation servers)

### 5. Better Status Result Handling

**New Status Types:**
- `completed_via_fallback`: Successful completion through recovery mechanism
- Enhanced `timeout` status with recovery information
- Detailed server status in timeout responses

**Improved User Feedback:**
- Context-aware status messages
- Fallback success indicators
- Server health status in error messages

## Expected Results

### Reduced Error Frequency
- **Adaptive Timeouts**: Longer tolerance for slow operations
- **Better Retry Logic**: More intelligent retry strategies
- **Fallback Recovery**: Success even when polling fails

### Improved User Experience
- **Less Alarming Messages**: More informative and helpful feedback
- **Context Awareness**: Users understand what happened and why
- **Recovery Indication**: Clear communication when fallback succeeds

### Enhanced System Resilience
- **Network Tolerance**: Better handling of temporary connection issues
- **Server Load Handling**: Graceful degradation during high load
- **Progressive Fallback**: Multiple recovery strategies

## Testing

### Validation Results
```
✅ Enhanced polling function: Found 'attemptGracefulFallback'
✅ Fallback completion status: Found 'completed_via_fallback'
✅ Extended timeout duration: Found '90000'
✅ Adaptive intervals: Found 'baseInterval'
✅ Enhanced health checks: Found 'maxRetries = 2'
✅ Better error messages: Found '状態確認にエラーがありましたが'
✅ Network resilience: Found 'consecutiveErrors'
✅ Graceful degradation: Found 'fallback_reason'
```

### Manual Testing
To test the improvements:

1. **Start the application**: `docker compose up`
2. **Trigger async operations**: Use commands that involve browser automation
3. **Observe improved messaging**: Notice more informative status updates
4. **Test network resilience**: Operations should recover better from temporary issues

### Monitoring
Use the enhanced health endpoint for monitoring:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## Impact Summary

These improvements significantly reduce the occurrence and impact of "実行状態の確認に失敗しました" errors by:

1. **Making the system more resilient** to temporary network issues
2. **Providing better recovery mechanisms** when polling fails
3. **Giving users more helpful information** instead of generic error messages
4. **Enabling graceful degradation** instead of complete failures

The changes maintain backward compatibility while providing a much more robust and user-friendly experience.
