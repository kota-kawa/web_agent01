# Browser Restart URL Preservation

## Problem
When the browser malfunctions and needs to be restarted during task execution, the system would return to the Yahoo homepage (default start URL), losing the user's current task context.

## Solution
Enhanced the `_recreate_browser()` function in `vnc/automation_server.py` to:

1. **Preserve Current URL**: Before closing the browser, save the current URL
2. **Filter Invalid URLs**: Skip restoration for:
   - `about:` pages (internal browser pages)
   - Default/start URLs (to avoid loops)
   - Empty or malformed URLs
3. **Robust Navigation**: Multiple retry attempts with different strategies:
   - First attempt: Full page load with network idle wait
   - Second attempt: DOM content loaded wait (faster)
   - Third attempt: Network idle wait (fallback)
4. **Graceful Failure**: If all restoration attempts fail, stay on current page instead of falling back to default URL

## Key Improvements

### Before
```
Browser malfunction → Restart → Navigate to Yahoo homepage → Task context lost
```

### After  
```
Browser malfunction → Restart → Navigate back to preserved URL → Task context retained
```

### Code Changes
- Enhanced URL validation to avoid restoring inappropriate URLs
- Added multiple retry strategies for navigation reliability
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added comprehensive test coverage

## Testing
New test file: `tests/test_browser_restart.py` validates:
- ✅ URL preservation for valid URLs
- ✅ Skipping invalid URLs (about: pages, default URLs)
- ✅ Multiple retry attempts on navigation failure
- ✅ Graceful handling when all retries fail

## Impact
Users can now continue their tasks seamlessly even when browser restarts are necessary due to technical issues, without losing their current page context.
